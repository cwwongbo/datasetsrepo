## 1. Crude oil import prices (Total, Toe/1 000 US dollars)
- Crude oil import prices come from the IEA's Crude Oil Import Register and are influenced not only by traditional movements of supply and demand, but also by other factors such as geopolitics. 
- Information is collected from national agencies according to the type of crude oil, by geographic origin and by quality of crude. 
- Average prices are obtained by dividing value by volume as recorded by customs administrations for each tariff position. 
- Values are recorded at the time of import and include cost, insurance and freight, but exclude import duties. 
- The nominal crude oil spot price from 2003 to 2011 is for Dubai and from 1970 to 2002 for Arabian Light. 
- This indicator is measured in USD per barrel of oil. The real price was calculated using the deflator for GDP at market prices and rebased with reference year 1970 = 100.

## 2. Renewable energy (Total, Thousand toe)
- Renewable energy is defined as the contribution of renewables to total primary energy supply (TPES). 
- Renewables include the primary energy equivalent of hydro (excluding pumped storage), geothermal, solar, wind, tide and wave sources. 
- Energy derived from solid biofuels, biogasoline, biodiesels, other liquid biofuels, biogases and the renewable fraction of municipal waste are also included. Biofuels are defined as fuels derived directly or indirectly from biomass (material obtained from living or recently living organisms). 
- This includes wood, vegetal waste (including wood waste and crops used for energy production), ethanol, animal materials/wastes and sulphite lyes. 
- Municipal waste comprises wastes produced by the residential, commercial and public service sectors that are collected by local authorities for disposal in a central location for the production of heat and/or power. 
- This indicator is measured in thousand toe (tonne of oil equivalent) as well as in percentage of total primary energy supply.

## 3. Electricity generation (Total, Gigawatt-hours)
- Electricity generation is defined as electricity generated from fossil fuels, nuclear power plants, hydro power plants (excluding pumped storage), geothermal systems, solar panels, biofuels, wind, etc. 
- It includes electricity produced in electricity-only plants and in combined heat and power plants. 
- Both main activity producer and autoproducer plants are included, where data are available. 
- Main activity producers generate electricity for sale to third parties as their primary activity. 
- Autoproducers generate electricity wholly or partly for their own use as an activity supporting their primary activity. Both types of plants may be privately or publicly owned. 
- This indicator is measured in gigawatt hours and in percentage of total energy generation

## 4. Crude oil production (Total, Thousand toe)
- Crude oil production is defined as the quantities of oil extracted from the ground after the removal of inert matter or impurities. It includes crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and additives. 
- This indicator is measured in thousand tonne of oil equivalent (toe).
- Crude oil is a mineral oil consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons of natural origin, yellow to black in colour, and of variable density and viscosity. 
- NGLs are the liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons produced in the manufacture, purification and stabilisation of natural gas. 
- Additives are non-hydrocarbon substances added to or blended with a product to modify its properties, for example, to improve its combustion characteristics (e.g. MTBE and tetraethyl lead).
- Refinery production refers to the output of secondary oil products from an oil refinery.

## 5. Primary energy supply (Total, Toe/1 000 US dollars)
- Primary energy supply is defined as energy production plus energy imports, minus energy exports, minus international bunkers, then plus or minus stock changes. 
- The International Energy Agency (IEA) energy balance methodology is based on the calorific content of the energy commodities and a common unit of account: tonne of oil equivalent (toe). Toe is defined as 107 kilocalories (41.868 gigajoules). 
- This quantity of energy is, within a few per cent, equal to the net heat content of one tonne of crude oil. 
- The difference between the “net” and the “gross” calorific value for each fuel is the latent heat of vaporisation of the water produced during combustion of the fuel. For coal and oil, net calorific value is about 5% less than gross, for most forms of natural and manufactured gas the difference is 9-10%, while for electricity the concept of calorific has no meaning. 
- The IEA calculates balances using the physical energy content method to find the primary energy equivalent. This indicator is measured in million toe and in toe per 1 000 USD.

## 6. Count of Nuclear Power Plan
- Nuclear power plants is defined as the number of nuclear units in operation as of 1 January 2019. It is measured as a number.
