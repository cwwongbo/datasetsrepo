# Energy Import Dependency
- The indicator is produced according to the high-level quality standards of European Statistical System. 
- Data description: Energy imports dependency shows the share of total energy needs of a country met by imports from other countries. The  rate shows the proportion of energy that an economy must import. It is defined as net energy imports divided by gross available energy, expressed as a percentage. It can be defined for all products total as well as for individual fuels (for example: crude oil, natural gas). All data are from energy balances.
  `Energy dependence = (imports â€“ exports) / gross available energy`
 - A negative dependency rate indicates a net exporter of energy while a dependency rate in excess of 100 % indicates that energy products have been stocked. 
- By definition, all nuclear energy production counts as domestic production, regardless the origin of fuel for nuclear fission/fussion. In similar manner, all renewables and biofules count as domestic production, regardless the origin of feedstock (biomass or waste) from which it was produced.
- Individual national data includes intra-EU trade. For EU aggregates, the net imports in principle cancel out all intra-EU trade (abstracting from statistical discrepancies in reported trade data: imports reported by country A from country B are not always exactly the same as exports by country B to country A).
